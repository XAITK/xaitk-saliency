    This saliency implementation transforms black-box
    image classification scores into saliency heatmaps. This should
    require a sequence of per-class confidences predicted on the
    reference image, a number of per-class confidences as predicted
    on perturbed images, as well as the masks of the reference image
    perturbations (as would be output from a
    `PerturbImage` implementation.

    The perturbation masks used by the following implementation are
    expected to be of type integer. Masks containing values of type
    float are rounded to the nearest value and binarized
    with value 1 replacing values greater than or equal to half of
    the maximum value in mask after rounding while 0 replaces the rest.

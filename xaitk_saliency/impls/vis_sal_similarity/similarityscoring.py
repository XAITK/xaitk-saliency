    """
    This saliency implementation transforms proximity in feature
    space into saliency heatmaps. This should
    require a sequence of feature vectors of the query and
    reference image, a number of feature vectors as predicted
    on perturbed images, as well as the masks of the reference image
    perturbations (as would be output from a
    `PerturbImage` implementation.

    The perturbation masks used by the following implementation are
    expected to be of type integer. Masks containing values of type
    float are rounded to the nearest value and binarized
    with value 1 replacing values greater than or equal to half of
    the maximum value in mask after rounding while 0 replaces the rest.

    param proximity_metric: The type of comparision metric used
        to determine proximity in feature space. The type of comparision
        metric supported is restricted by scipy's cdist() function. The
        following metrics are supported in scipy.

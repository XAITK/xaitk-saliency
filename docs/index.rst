Welcome to xaitk-saliency's documentation!
==========================================

Welcome to the documentation for XAITK-Saliency. As part of the Explainable
AI Toolkit (XAITK), XAITK-Saliency is an open source, explainable AI framework for visual saliency algorithm interfaces
and implementations, built for analytics and autonomy applications.
The xaitk-saliency package provides saliency algorithms for a wide range of image understanding
tasks, including image classification, image similarity, object detection, and reinforcement
learning. The current list of supported saliency algorithms can be found in :ref:`Saliency
Algorithms`.

This documentation is structured to provide you with straightforward and practical instructions and examples, so that
you can effectively leverage the toolkit to enhance the robustness and reliability of your computer vision applications
in facing real-world challenges.

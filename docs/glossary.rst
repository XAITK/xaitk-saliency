   black-box model
     A machine learning model whose internal decision-making process is not accessible or interpretable by users.

   classifier
     A model that outputs a predicted label or category based on input features.

   detector
     A model that identifies multiple objects within an image by predicting their categories and bounding boxes based on
     input features.

   explanation
     A conceptual or visual interpretation of why a model produced a specific output.

   MC-RISE
     Multi-Color RISE — a variant of RISE that incorporates color information when generating saliency maps.

   occlusion
     A saliency technique that hides parts of the input data to evaluate changes in model predictions.

   perturbation
     A small, intentional change applied to input data (e.g. noise, occlusion) to test the sensitivity of
     model outputs.

   RISE
     Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation — a black-box saliency algorithm that generates saliency maps by sampling
     randomly masked inputs.

   saliency algorithm
     A computational method for estimating which input regions are most influential in a model’s prediction.

   saliency map
     A visual representation that highlights input regions (e.g. parts of an image) most relevant to a
     model’s decision.

   similarity scoring
     The process of measuring how alike two inputs are, often used in retrieval, ranking, or tracking tasks.

   superpixels
     Groups of adjacent pixels with similar color and texture used as regions in some saliency techniques.

   visualization
     The display of data or model behavior (e.g. saliency maps) in a human-interpretable format to aid understanding.

   white-box model
     A machine learning model whose internal logic, parameters, and feature importance are transparent to and
     interpretable by users (e.g. decision trees, linear regression).

   XAI
     Explainable Artificial Intelligence — methods and tools that help humans understand, trust, and interpret
     machine learning outputs.

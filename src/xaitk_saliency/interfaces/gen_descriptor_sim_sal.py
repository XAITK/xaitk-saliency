    Visual saliency map generation interface whose implementations transform
    black-box feature vectors from multiple references and perturbations into
    saliency heatmaps.

    This transformation requires a reference image, and a number of query images
    all translated into feature vectors via some black-box means.
    We are trying to discern the feature-space saliency between the reference
    image and each query image.
    This also requires the feature vectors for perturbed versions of the
    reference images as well as the masks of the perturbations as would be
    output from a :class:`xaitk_saliency.interfaces.perturb_image.PerturbImage`
    implementation.
    The resulting saliency heatmaps are relative to the reference image.

        Generate a matrix of visual saliency heatmaps given the black-box
        descriptor generation output on a reference image, several query images,
        perturbed versions of the reference image and the masks of the visual
        perturbations.

        Perturbation mask input into the `perturbed_masks` parameter here is
        equivalent to the perturbation mask output from a
        :meth:`xaitk_saliency.interfaces.perturb_image.PerturbImage.perturb`
        method implementation.
        We expect perturbations to be relative to the reference image.
        These should have the shape `[nMasks x H x W]`, and values in range
        [0, 1], where a value closer to 1 indicates areas of the image that
        are *unperturbed*.
        Note the type of values in masks can be either integer, floating point
        or boolean within the above range definition.
        Implementations are responsible for handling these expected variations.

        Generated saliency heatmap matrices should be floating-point typed and
        be composed of values in the [-1,1] range.
        Positive values of the saliency heatmaps indicate regions which increase
        image similarity scores, while negative values indicate regions which
        decrease image similarity scores according to the model that generated
        input feature vectors.

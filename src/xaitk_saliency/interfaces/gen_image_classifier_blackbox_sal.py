"""
Module for generating visual saliency heatmaps from image classifiers.

This module provides the `GenerateImageClassifierBlackboxSaliency` class, which is used to generate per-class visual
saliency heatmaps for an image classifier black-box. The saliency maps indicate which regions of the image are most
influential in the classifier's decision-making process for each class label.

The `GenerateImageClassifierBlackboxSaliency` class takes a reference image and a classifier that implements the
`smqtk_classifier.ClassifyImage` interface, and outputs saliency heatmaps for each predicted class. These heatmaps are
used to interpret the classifier's behavior, by showing how different parts of the image contribute to the classifier's
confidence in each class.

    A classifier black box needs to be input, which requires some

        The input reference image is expected to be in matrix form and be in
        either a `H x W` or `H x W x C` shape format.

        Output saliency map matrix should be (1) in the shape `nClasses x H x W`,

        the reference image's `H` and `W` dimensions.
        Positive values of the saliency heatmaps indicate regions that
        increase respective class confidence scores, while negative values

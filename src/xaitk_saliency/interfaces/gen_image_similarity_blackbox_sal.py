    This interface describes the generation of visual saliency heatmaps based on
    the similarity of a reference image to a number of query images.
    Similarity is deduced from the output of a black-box image feature vector
    generator that transforms each image to an embedding space.

    The resulting saliency maps are relative to the reference image.
    As such, each map denotes regions in the reference image that make it more
    or less similar to the corresponding query image.

    The `smqtk_descriptors.ImageDescriptorGenerator` interface is used to
    provide a common format for image feature vector generation.

        Generates visual saliency maps based on the similarity of the reference
        image to each query image determined by the output of the blackbox
        feature vector generator.

        The input reference image is expected to be a matrix in
        either a `H x W` or `H x W x C` shape format.
        The input query images should be a sequence of matrices, each of which
        should also be in either `H x W` or `H x W x C` format.
        Each query image is not required to have the same shape, however.

        The output saliency map matrix should be (1) of shape
        `nQueryImgs x H x W` with matching height and width to the reference
        image, (2) floating-point typed, and (3) composed of values in the
        `[-1, 1]` range.

        The `(0, 1]` range is intended to describe regions that are positively
        salient, and the `[-1, 0)` range is intended to describe regions that
        are negatively salient.
        Positive values of each saliency heatmap indicate regions of the
        reference image that increase its similarity to the corresponding query
        image, while negative values indicate regions that actively decrease its
        similarity to the corresponding query image.

        Similarity is determined by the output of the feature vector generator
        and implementation specifics.

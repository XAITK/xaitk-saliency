class SquaredDifferenceScoring(GenerateClassifierConfidenceSaliency):
    """
    This saliency implementation transforms black-box confidence predictions
    from a classification-style network into saliency heatmaps. This should
    require a sequence of classification scores predicted on the reference
    image, a number of classification scores predicted on perturbed images, as
    well as the masks of the reference image perturbations (as would be output
    from a `PerturbImage` implementation).

    This implementation uses the squared difference of the reference scores and
    the perturbed scores to compute the saliency maps. This gives an indication
    of general saliency without distinguishing between positive and negative.
    The resulting maps are normalized between the range [0,1].

    Based on Greydanus et. al:

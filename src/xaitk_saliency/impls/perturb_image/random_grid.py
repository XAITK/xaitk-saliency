class RandomGrid(PerturbImage):
    """
    Generate masks using a random grid of set cell size. If the chosen cell
    size does not divide an image evenly, then the grid is over-sized and
    the resulting mask is centered and cropped. Each mask is also shifted
    randomly by a maximum of half the cell size in both x and y.

    This method is based on RISE (http://bmvc2018.org/contents/papers/1064.pdf)
    but aims to address the changing cell size, given images of different
    sizes, aspect of that implementation. This method keeps cell size constant
    and instead adjusts the overall grid size for different sized images.

    :param n: Number of masks to generate.
    :param s: Dimensions of the grid cells in pixels. E.g. (3, 4) would use
        a grid of 3x4 pixel cells.
    :param p1: Probability of a grid cell being set to 1 (not occluded).
        This should be a float value in the [0, 1] range.
    :param seed: A seed to use for the random number generator, allowing
        for masks to be reproduced.
    :param threads: Number of threads to use when generating masks. If this
        is <=0 or None, no threading is used and processing is performed
        in-line serially.
